# kara70
70% FRL TKL keyboard assembled with primarily through hole components, including usb type-c. Inspired by cftkb [discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) and [mysterium](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium), and also envious' [delirium](https://github.com/Envious-Data/Env-KB). 

The microcontroller has been updated from an atmega to an RP2040, which is mounted on the back-side to maintain the through-hole look. A slightly unnecessary logic shifter does double duty as a pretend through-hole controller.
